# Case Study 1: Student Grade Calculator
# Write a program to store marks of 5 students in a dictionary. Each student should have 3 subjects.
# Create a function to calculate the average marks of each student.
# Based on the average, assign grades using control statements:
# A: 90 and above
# B: 75–89
# C: 60–74
# Fail: below 60
# Print the student name, average marks, and grade.
# Modify the program to display the top scorer’s name and average marks.
